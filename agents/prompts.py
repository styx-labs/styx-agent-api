headless_evaluate_prompt = """
    You are an expert technical recruiter specializing in evaluating candidates based on their professional profiles.
    Your task is to evaluate a candidate's fit for a specific role using their profile, the job requirements, and calibration data from previous evaluations.
    
    Output format required:
    1. Score (0-4)
    2. Reasoning (max 100 words, without mentioning the numerical score)

    Scoring criteria:
    0 - No match: Candidate lacks core requirements and relevant experience
    1 - Poor match: Candidate meets few requirements, experience is tangential
    2 - Potential match: Candidate meets some requirements, may need development
    3 - Strong match: Candidate meets most requirements, experience aligns well
    4 - Excellent match: Candidate exceeds requirements, experience is highly relevant

    Evaluation guidelines:
    - Compare candidate's experience directly against job requirements and descriptions
    - Use calibration examples to benchmark your evaluation
    - Maintain objectivity and avoid assumptions about gender/demographics

    Candidate Profile:
    Name: {candidate_name}
    {candidate_context}

key_traits_prompt = """
    You are an expert hiring manager at a company.
    You are given a job description and a list of ideal candidate profiles for the job.
    Using the given information, create a list of traits that candidate sourcers will use to decide which candidates to source and reach out to.
    Extract information from the job description and the ideal candidate profiles to create the traits.

    For each requirement, provide:
    - A short, specific trait name (not a full sentence)
    - A detailed description of the trait that will tell a sourcer what to look for in a candidate. This should be detailed - assume that the sourcer has no experience with the job and the company.
    - Whether the trait is required or a "nice to have"

    Guidelines:
    - Extract 5-7 key traits that best represent the job requirements
    - Traits should not be redundant
    - Traits should be specific and concrete (e.g. "Experience with distributed systems" not just "Technical skills")
    - Include any hard requirements only if they are mentioned in the job description (e.g. education, years of experience)
    - Traits should all be answerable by a yes/no question

    Here is the job description:
    {job_description}
    Here is the list of ideal profiles for the job:

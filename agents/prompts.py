key_traits_prompt = """
    You are an expert hiring manager at a company.
    You are given a job description and a list of ideal candidate profiles for the job.
    Using the given information, create a list of traits that candidate sourcers will use to decide which candidates to source and reach out to.
    Extract information from the job description and the ideal candidate profiles to create the traits.

    For each requirement, provide:
    - A short, specific trait name (not a full sentence)
    - A detailed description of the trait that will tell a sourcer what to look for in a candidate. This should have step by step instructions on how to decide if the trait is present - assume that the sourcer has no experience with the job and the company.
    - Whether the trait is required or a "nice to have"

    Guidelines:
    - Extract 5-7 key traits that best represent the job requirements
    - Traits should not be redundant
    - Traits should be specific and concrete (e.g. "Experience with distributed systems" not just "Technical skills")
    - Include any hard requirements only if they are mentioned in the job description (e.g. education, years of experience)
    - Traits should all be answerable by a yes/no question

    Here is the job description:
    {job_description}

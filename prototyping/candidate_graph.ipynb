      "Most relevant content from source: Contributing to Open-Source Walkthrough Part 3 | by Kevin Jin | Medium Now I will open a PR: Although josedejong should get a Github notification anyways that I opened a PR, I just follow up and tag him in the original issue, just in case. Travis CI does continuous integration, building and running tests for each commit and/or PR I forgot to run any linting when I opened the PR, but it’s not too late to add a fix for the linting now. Adding (lint) fixes to my PR I notice the code I added to gulpfile.js is formatted a bit better, which means the lint fixing worked. Thanks for reading and best of luck on your own open source contributions!\n",

      "Most relevant content from source: Contributing to Open-Source Walkthrough Part 0 | by Kevin Jin | Medium Contributing to Open-Source Walkthrough Part 0 Working on open source can feel like adding or fixing a gear in a complex machine (Image by Digital Buggu) There are quite a few guides on the Internet on how to contribute to open source, but none so far I’ve seen that walks through the whole process of an open source contribution (Whole process as in finding an open source repo to contribute to, to getting your contribution merged in). This guide is great if you just want to contribute to open source. Choose an Open Source Project and Issue (Part 1) Find or create a list of semi-popular and popular open source projects. Opening and Merging the PR (Part 3) Follow the repo’s appropriate steps to write the PR Open Source\n",

      "Most relevant content from source: A reason why many beginners find open source software (OSS) development difficult is because they decide to work on a project like React or Node.js, that everyone knows about, where the code base is pretty robust and people are always competing to work on issues. You can tell from the ratio of open to closed PRs, how recent the last PR was, and the number of comments on each PR, that if you make a PR to this repo, a project maintainer will probably review it and help get it merged. There are quite a few issues that are available to work on, but I chose #1442 since it looks relatively simple, and it’s my first time contributing to this project.\n",
